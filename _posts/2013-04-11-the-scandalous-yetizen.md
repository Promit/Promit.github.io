There's been a lot of chatter on the various blogs and news sites about the IGDA and Yetizen party incident. I'm not going to rehash that. See these articles if you're not up to date on the whole controversy:

I will comment that I thought that the controversy was a wholly pointless manufactured thing and Brenda Romero's resignation did not help anybody. That said, I was a little surprised to discover that the scandalous, allegedly inappropriate outfits that created all this trouble aren't actually shown anywhere, in any of the news about the incident. At all. Not on Joystiq, not on the Gawker owned Kotaku, nowhere. I thought that was strange. Luckily I have photos of the Yetizen models from the previous year, so... here it is. This is the outfit that forced two IGDA members to resign.
