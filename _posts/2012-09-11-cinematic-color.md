I chose not to go to SIGGRAPH 2012, and I'm starting to wish I had. Via <a href="http://lousodrome.net/blog/light/2012/09/11/readings-on-color-management/">Julien Guertault</a>, I found the course on <a href="http://cinematiccolor.com/">Cinematic Color</a>.

I've mentioned this in the past: I believe that as a graphics programmer, a thorough understanding of photography and cinematography through the entire production pipeline is necessary. Apparently I am not alone in this regard. Interesting corollary: should cinematographers understand computer graphics? Hmm.
