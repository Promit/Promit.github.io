In order to try PhysX, I have to request a developer account, then have it approved. No idea how long that process takes, but <a href="http://supportcenteronline.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=1949">there's no real reason to find out</a>:
<blockquote>Update:  We expect it may take another 2 weeks before the SDK is available for download as we continue to have issues with our secure download server.</blockquote>
So not only do I have to go through your contrived process, you fools can't even get your shit together enough to make the download available within <i>two weeks</i>. Why on earth would I use a library that's in the hands of such incompetent people?

I downloaded Havok without hassle and that will likely be my choice from now on.

It's kind of sad, actually. I originally started using PhysX when it was still called Novodex, several years ago. Back then it was a lean, fast library with good documentation and helpful support. Now, I have to install a driver just to use it, as do all my users. And that's assuming I can get a hold of the damn library at all anymore. I thought maybe being sold from Ageia to NVIDIA would help, as NVIDIA's developer support is generally pretty good. I was wrong.
