I've been quiet for a very long time now, and this is why. We've just shipped our new game, <a href="http://slugbugsgame.com/">Slug Bugs!

It uses our Ghost binaural audio which I've teased several times in the past, and is also wicked fun to play. Please check it out! A little later in the week I'll probably discuss the development more.
