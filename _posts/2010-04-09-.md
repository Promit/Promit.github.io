I am frequently very negative about things, and I've been <A href="http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/mod/journal/journal.asp?jn=433428&amp;reply_id=2959299">very critical of OpenGL in the past</a>. Today, I've decided to write down things I <I>like</i> about OpenGL, as many as I can think of.  Don't get me wrong -- I still think it's a shoddy, second rate API designed for entirely the wrong decade and managed by incompetent people. But credit where credit's due, at least. 
<ul>
	<li>The 3.x series is actually improving things. Yes, it represented an epic bait and switch, the kind that would have the masses howling about if Microsoft had done something so shitty. But...they're taking things out of the API finally, simplifying the code paths, and generally streamlining things a lot.</li>
	<li>Fairly decent documentation. This is a relatively recent innovation in OpenGL-land, where there's actually coherent documentation that is also well organized, easily accessible, and generally useful. The spec documents are actually quite good and right up front, too. Just don't look over into Windows-land documentation.</li>
