I guess what I posted about <a href="http://slimtune.com">SlimTune</a> must have made the rounds or something, cause three days after I said what I was doing, a new NProf was released. Here I went to all this trouble of creating a new profiler, and all I really had to do was complain :D

I haven't played with the new iteration in detail, but it does seem to have some nice new touches. I don't actually believe it'll be a competitor for me once I'm done -- but hey, his is functional. Mine's just a toy right now. I'm willing to concede at least that much. It'll do the job for most people.

On a side note, after discussing with friends, I'm decided to use MIT license after all. I think it's more advantageous to me to relieve any legal concerns that anybody may have than to maintain some vague semblance of control over the code. I've also more or less confirmed that SlimTune will be able to profile fully native apps eventually. It won't be a feature in the initial release, most likely, but it's coming.
