It's fairly common to integrate source control into Explorer, Visual Studio, or both. I've learned over time that both of these are fairly awful. For Subversion, shell integration comes in the form of far and away the most popular client for Windows, TortoiseSVN. VS integration usually comes by way of AnkhSVN or VisualSVN. Similarly, Perforce includes P4EXP for explorer and P4SCC for Visual Studio.

I'll start with Visual Studio because I've found that's the more worthless of the two. The problem with VS integration for source control is that it's god awful
