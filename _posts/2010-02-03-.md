Six years and a few months ago, in late 2003, I reached the same point as countless other high school students. The time came to select colleges, apply, and eventually find out where the next several years of my life would be spent. I finished my undergraduate degree last week. It's a good time to reflect on how things got to the point they're at. And to be honest, I feel like I went into the whole process severely lacking in relevant information. My limited discussions with friends suggest I'm not alone in feeling this way.
