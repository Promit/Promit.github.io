I was going to write up a little thing about some of the goals I have for the upcoming November release of SlimDX, but then I remembered I'm going out to dinner with my girlfriend tonight. Strictly speaking it's been ten months since our first date, but it was around mid October that I first started getting to know her. More to the point, I picked up some Restaurant.com gift certificates super cheap ($25 certificates for $2 each), which she doesn't know about yet. Basically we're going to the local Indian place and eating all super nice like. These certificates have a $35 minimum and it's your typical $12 entree type restaurant, so drinks and dessert are a definite yes.

And she just called me. I'm out.
