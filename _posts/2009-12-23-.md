I've tried to write and talk about this topic several times, with varying levels of success or failure. Components are a powerful approach to building up a game, but I've found explaining them to be difficult without examples. I'm going to try to cover them properly this time, and find a more structured approach. It's further complicated by the fact that the languages we conventionally use in game development just aren't <i>built</i> for it. Still, components can be an incredibly effective system and I'd like to discuss them more thoroughly.

I typically reference the GDC presentation Scott Bilas gave about Dungeon Siege, but that becomes complex quickly and glosses over a lot of the basic details.
