I'll concede it doesn't look like much, but honestly, the game is really addictive and fun. And it's a <i>dollar</i>.

One of the technologies in this is the binaural audio system that I <a href="http://ventspace.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/binaural-audio-follow-up/">discussed earlier</a>. On the above page, there's a linked video -- <b>put on headphones</b> and watch it. You'll get the point very quickly. It's even better in-game than in the video, was my experience.

There's also the animation system, which is not really shown off that well here, but it's procedurally constructed, like NaturalMotion (but better, we believe). At no point were any animations build in a modeler. It's all done dynamically using relatively simple rules. The future games will leverage this tech more heavily, but at least as developers I think you can appreciate how awesome that is. The flying, the hits -- it's all physics based.

Did I mention it's a dollar? Try it out. And if you do try it out, please take the time to write an honest (and hopefully positive!) review. It'll go a long way for us if you do.
