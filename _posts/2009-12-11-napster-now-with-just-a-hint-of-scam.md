I just want to point out two things with Napster.
* If you sign up for their free trial, they will automatically start billing you when it ends unless you cancel before that.
* You have to call them to cancel; there is no online option to unsubscribe.

While I'm not making any accusations, these are both classic attributes of online scams. On the bright side, when I did cancel my subscription (being generally unsatisfied with the shitty software they provide), they did not hassle me.

[EDIT] Someone asked for elaboration about the software. I liked that Napster's software was <i>vastly</i> faster than Zune could ever hope to be. Zune 4.0 performs decently (unlike 3.x) but the web service is appallingly slow and browsing takes forever. However, the Napster software is a pain with overall usability, and I experienced some stability problems as well. I do want to say that these problems are no worse than with iTunes or Zune, both of which also suck. All of them are a far cry from WMP12 though, and I'd probably be most inclined to switch to Songbird if I got tired of WMP. (And apps are the only reason I use iTunes, or I'd almost certainly jump ship to Songbird.)
