I wrote this a while back and I keep losing it. Maybe now that it's here, it won't get lost again.
<hr>

Sittin' down, back in the cube
Ate my lunch, took a quick break
Went to Wendy's, now I'm back with my code
Just a man and his dual monitors

So many times, it crashes too fast
You trade your soda for coffee
Don't lose your grip on the mouse and keyboard
You must fight to keep yourself awake

It's the eye of the coder, it's the thrill of the bug
Risin' up to the challenge of our deadline
And the remote debugger tracks your code in the night
And I'm watchin' it all with the eye of the coder

Face to screen, in the office
Hangin' tough, stayin' focused
They report bugs, till we track them all down
For the build that we can mark as gold

It's the eye of the coder, it's the thrill of the bug
Risin' up to the challenge of our deadline
And the remote debugger tracks your code in the night
And I'm watchin' it all with the eye of the coder

Sittin' down, back in the cube
Have the docs, got the coffee
Set the breakpoint, now I'm gonna fix it
Just a man and his dual monitors

It's the eye of the coder, it's the thrill of the bug
Risin' up to the challenge of our deadline
And the remote debugger tracks your code in the night
And I'm watchin' it all with the eye of the coder

The eye of the coder
The eye of the coder
The eye of the coder
