I am working on Part 2 of my Digital Color posts, but it won't be ready for a while yet. The goal of that post is to talk all about luminance, brightness, gamma, and the various other attributes and properties of how light a color is, rather than what shade it is.

In the meantime, please accept my apology and consider reading this page I found: the <a href="http://www.poynton.com/notes/colour_and_gamma/GammaFAQ.html">Gamma FAQ</a> by Charles Poynton.
