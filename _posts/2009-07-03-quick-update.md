So I'm heading home for the weekend, and I've exhausted my queue of posts for the moment. I'll be bringing you guys the next part of the SlimDX Architecture series some time next week, and we'll see where things go from there. I'm also going to evaluate whether or not to do an interim SlimDX release for July; I've just gotten word that the SDK is not going to be released for some time.
