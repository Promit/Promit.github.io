Man it's been a long time since I posted here. Company is going great. It'll probably be a few more months until I can really say anything, though.<hr>

I've decided to keep up a list of the various software packages and other projects where SlimDX is used. This used to live on our wiki, but that was killed off a long time ago. I've also been somewhat cagey about what games are built on SlimDX, but I may as well make the listing public. Can't think of a good reason not to. If I'm missing anything, please feel free to post a comment or drop me an email.

These are in no particular order. All of them are for Windows platforms.
