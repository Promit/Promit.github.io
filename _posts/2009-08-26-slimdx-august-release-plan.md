I probably don't need to tell you that it has been an incredibly long time since the last SlimDX release. That's because it has been an incredibly long time since the last DirectX release. The reason seems to be somewhat quirky schedule planning on Microsoft's part; basically they've decided to hold out on the next SDK until they have a completely stable Windows 7 compatible release. (IMO they should've done a release in June but okay fine.)

I do know two things. One, the SDK is branded as August, so unless they screw this up really badly it should arrive soon. Today is Wednesday; my guess is it'll show up Friday mid-day. I have confirmed that there's a bunch of new functionality coming, which of course we'll have to wrap. That will take some time. Not sure exactly how much, but it will be at least a few days to write and check that code. IOW, our August release will actually come out in early September sometime, hopefully before Labor Day. It will have fully merged support for 10.1, 11, and Direct2D. DirectWrite remains as a maybe.
