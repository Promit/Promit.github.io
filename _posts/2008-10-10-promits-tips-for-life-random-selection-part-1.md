I truly regret watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j50ZssEojtM">this video</a>.<hr />
<ul>
	<li><strong>#5:</strong> If someone is looking at you funny, consider the possibility that they may suffer from chronic creepiness, rather than intending actual funny looks.</li>
	<li><strong>#23:</strong> Generally speaking, it's best to avoid bringing lions, tigers, or bears to the mall, even if they're just babies. Oh my.</li>
	<li><strong>#49:</strong> Getting up close to someone's face and singing Nine Inch Nails lyrics is not a good way to make friends.</li>
	<li><strong>#70:</strong> Yes, you can still rock out like it's 1998, even if it was ten years ago.  Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic...</li>
	<li><strong>#91:</strong> Don't bother trying to come up with the stupidest comment ever made to someone on the internet. You're way out of your league.</li>
</ul>
