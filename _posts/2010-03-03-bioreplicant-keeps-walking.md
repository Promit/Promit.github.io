This is what we've been working on for the last several months at AR Labs.
<blockquote>Forget falls.
Forget tackles.
BioReplicant keeps walking.

-----------------------
BioReplicants is a completely reactive procedural animation system for use in video games. No key framing, motion capture, or precomputed animations were used. Everything you see here was generated in real-time, reacting to human input. Oh, and it's efficient enough to run on an iPhone.

We know he looks crazy. Sure we could've made it realistic, but it's just not that interesting to watch. BioReplicant can keep going even through bone crushing impacts, and we think that's pretty cool. </blockquote>
We'll be showing off the LIVE DEMO at GDC. Catch up with us to try it out!
