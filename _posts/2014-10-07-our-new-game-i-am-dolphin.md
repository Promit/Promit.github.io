After an incredibly long time of quiet development, our new game, I Am Dolphin, will be available this Thursday, October 9th, on the Apple/iOS App Store. This post will be discussing the background and the game itself; I'm planning to post more technical information about the game and development in the future. This depends somewhat on people reading and commenting - tell me what you want to know about the work and I'm happy to answer as much as I can.

<p style="text-align:left;">For those of you who may not have followed my career path over time: A close friend and I have spent quite a few years doing R&amp;D with purely physically driven animation. There's plenty of work out there on the subject; ours is not based on any of it and takes a completely different approach. About three years ago, we met a neurologist at the Johns Hopkins Hospital who helped us set up a small research group at Hopkins to study biological motion and create a completely new simulation system from the ground up, based around neurological principles and hands-on study of dolphins at the National Aquarium in Baltimore. Unlike many other physical animation systems, including our own previous work, the new work allows the physical simulation to be controlled as a player character. We also developed a new custom in-house framework, called the Kata Engine, to make the simulation work possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">One of the goals in developing this controllable simulation was to learn more about human motor control, and specifically to investigate how to apply this technology to recovery from motor impairments such as stroke. National Geographic was kind enough to write some great articles on our motivations and approach:</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Although the primary application of our work is medical and scientific, we've also spent our spare time to create a game company, Max And Haley LLC, and a purely entertainment focused version of the game. This is the version that will be publicly available in a scant few days.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Here is a <a href="http://www.appunwrapper.com/2014/10/06/i-am-dolphin-ios-simulation-game-allows-you-to-become-a-dolphin/">review of the game by AppUnwrapper</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">I got my hands on the beta version of the game, and it’s incredibly impressive and addictive. I spent two hours playing right off the bat without even realizing it, and have put in quite a few more hours since. I just keep wanting to come back to it. iPhones and iPads are the perfect platform for the game, because they allow for close and personal, tactile controls via simple swipes across the screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">I now have three shipped titles to my name; I'd say this is the first one I'm really personally proud of. It's my firm belief that we've created something that is completely unique in the gaming world, without being a gimmick. Every creature is a complete physical simulation. The dolphins you control respond to your swipes, not by playing pre-computed animation sequences but by actually incorporating your inputs into the drive parameters of the underlying simulation. The end result is a game that represents actual motion control, not gesture-recognition based selection of pre-existing motions.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As I said at the beginning of the post, this is mostly a promotional announcement. However, this is meant to be a technical blog, not my promotional mouthpiece. I want to dig in a lot to the actual development and technical aspects of this game. There's a lot to talk about in the course of developing a game with a three person (2x coder, 1x artist) team, building a complete <em>cross-platform </em>engine from nothing, all in the backdrop of an academic research hospital environment. Then there's the actual development of the simulation, which included a lot of interaction with the dolphins, the trainers, and the Aquarium staff. We did a lot of filming (but no motion capture!) in the course of the development as well; I'm hoping to share some of that footage moving forward.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Here's a slightly older trailer - excuse the wrong launch date on this version. We decided to slip the release by two months after this was created - that's worth a story in itself. It is not fully representative of the final product, but our final media isn't quite ready.</p>
