Here's a quick teaser of the new UI:
<a href="http://ventspace.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/020610-newui2.jpg"><img src="http://ventspace.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/020610-newui2.jpg?w=300" alt="" title="New UI (Take 2)" width="300" height="195" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-496" /></a>
The window hosting the visualizer is missing all of its widgets, but will eventually have a variety of controls along the edges. The revised main SlimTune window is essentially complete. This window is always open as long as SlimTune is running, and maintains a list of the connections that are active. One window, one connection, and closing one closes the other. It's much easier to keep track of things this way, and the individual windows can be hidden away to reduce clutter if desired.

[EDIT] Starting to think I should stop using JPEG. Even at 100%, it does some horrible things to text.
