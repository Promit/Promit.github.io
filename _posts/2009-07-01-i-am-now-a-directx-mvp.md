I've just been awarded XNA/DirectX MVP status by Microsoft! I'm still poking around the new sites I've been given access to, but there's a lot of cool stuff here, courtesy of Microsoft. They're giving me MSDN and TechNet subscriptions, for example, which I'm thrilled about. I'm also eager to finally have access to the private MVP newsgroup, since it's not uncommon that I have questions related to SlimDX development that really need an answer from the DirectX team itself.

In short, this is pretty awesome.
