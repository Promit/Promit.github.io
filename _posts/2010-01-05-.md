I'm currently working on the front-end data collection system for SlimTune, and I have to be perfectly honest: I don't know what people want from instrumentation. I thought I'd ask.

Sampling profilers are really awesome. Even at laughably low sampling frequencies, they produce extremely useful data that provides an accurate breakdown of how an application spends its time, overall.
