Q: When should you use singletons?
A: Not ever.

Most absolute advice is bad advice. Never use goto? No point. And today, I'm here to give you some absolute advice, or as close as it gets. There is [i]no[/i] sane use for the singleton pattern. Not in my code, not in your code, not in anyone's code. It's not okay because Ogre3D does it.
