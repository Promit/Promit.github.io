I'm not as big a fan of Visual Assist X as some people. It's a great tool, but there are really only a handful of features that matter to me. Probably the biggest one is that it has a dialog that lists ALL the files in your solution in a flat alphabetically sorted list, with progressive search (like iTunes). That dialog is godly, and so I was thrilled to discover the <A href="http://jens-schaller.de/sonictools/sonicfilefinder/index.htm">Sonic File Finder add-in</A> for Visual Studio. It adds that dialog, and works gloriously.

It's worth installing.
