Just a quick update here: My domains, primarily SlimDX.org and SlimTune.com but a few others as well, are currently hosted by GoGaddy. Now GoDaddy is a company with a long, messy history of being a third tier sleaze-bag registrar, but I stuck with them because of pricing. However their recent support of SOPA, and their pathetic recant, pushed me over the edge.

Effective immediately, I am shifting all domains away from GoDaddy. Because I'm rather new to this process, I don't know what will happen to DNS and email during the transition. SlimDX or @slimdx.org addresses may become inaccessible for a short period while I sort things out. Please bear with me.

If you are interested in moving your own domains, I found out that NameCheap is running a promotion with code "SOPAsucks". Their pricing is not quite as aggressive as GoDaddy but it appears that they do offer very competitive pricing ($2 specials) nonetheless. Transfers with the code cost $6.99 per domain, which includes a year renewal of the domain. I am sure there are other anti-SOPA registrars but this one is mine.
