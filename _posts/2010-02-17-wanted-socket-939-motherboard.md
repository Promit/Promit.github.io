I'm looking for a s939 (AMD) motherboard to put together a mini server system for pretty much all my work (SlimDX, SlimTune, AR Labs). I have all the other pieces, it's just the mobo I'm missing. If someone is willing to send me an old but working one -- preferably micro ATX -- they're not using, that would be amazing. I will pay shipping.

I don't want to really push anyone into gutting a working system, though. If you can include a processor that would be great, because I'm not sure if the one I have works. 2 sticks of memory would be helpful too -- I've got two but why stop there?

Let me know if you guys have anything lying around.
