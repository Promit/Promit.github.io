I promised this a long time ago, and here it is. I prefer to let the video speak for itself. This is a demo from January, so it's actually a much older iteration of what we've got now.

P.S. Of course I delete negative comments. It's my damn blog!

<b>UPDATE:</b> The video has been pulled for a while until we get a new one that better reflects the state of the technology.
