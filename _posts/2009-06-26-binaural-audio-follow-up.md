When I last posted, the demo video was the Barbershop recording. Although it's an excellent video, it's not ours and the only media I had to show that was actually by us was an eight second clip that was not terribly impressive. That is no longer the case!

The game is previewed, with the real in game sound, near the end. But listen to the whole thing, and remember that it works in real time on pretty much any current platform. With any luck, we'll have an SDK ready for Q1 2010, maybe even earlier.

Oh, and that's <i>still</i> part 1. If you're interested in animation and if you think that what NaturalMotion did was pretty cool, you'll be in for a big treat later on.

P.S. I answer all comments, generally speaking, although it might be a bit delayed at times. So don't think I'm not noticing.
