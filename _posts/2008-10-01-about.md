I'm Promit Roy. I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a computer science degree and am currently working on my Master's Degree there. My prior work experience includes Day 1 Studios, NVIDIA, and Microsoft. I previously developed the BioReplicant physical animation technology, and a few mobile games. I primarily work in depth on games for medical and scientific research, using physics based simulations of biological motion and human motion control systems.

I'm the lead developer on SlimDX, an open source library for DirectX support in .NET. I'm also developing SlimTune, an open source profiler for .NET software. I serve as a moderato, technical editor, and top member for GameDev.Net. Microsoft awarded me XNA/DirectX MVP status for my work during 2009-2012. I can be found on <a href="http://twitter.com/promit_roy">Twitter</a>, or you may email me directly.

I offer consulting services related to DirectX, SlimDX, computer graphics, and system integration (especially C#/C++) as well. Please contact me at promit.roy@gmail.com or promit@slimdx.org if you are interested in hiring me.
