This is a topic that didn't really make it into the documentation; for the time being I will cover it here. SlimTune can track system performance counters -- any of them -- while it's profiling, reporting them in a nice graph format. There used to be a set of default counters in the list, but I ran into a bug related to serialization and had to drop them for 0.2.1. I'll briefly explain how to use them.

The first step is to figure out what performance counters you want. There's a lot of them, divided up into different categories. One useful set is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x2tyfybc%28VS.80%29.aspx">.NET CLR Memory</a> category. You can find documentation about lots of other counters out there; for now we'll stick to the Process and .NET CLR Memory categories, since those are the ones I like. 

In SlimTune's Run dialog, one of the properties to set will be called Performance counters. It's a collection of strings, each one a counter you'd like to track. Enter these lines:
[code]
Process\% Processor Time
Process\Private Bytes
.NET CLR Memory\# Gen 0 Collections
[/code]
This is the simplified syntax for counters in SlimTune. Once you run your code, you'll start getting reports of the values of the counters.
